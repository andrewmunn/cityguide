# cityguide
City guide demo Android app!
Libraries used:

Otto
OkHttp
ButterKnife
Guava
RecyclerView

City guide shows a list of nearby Bars, Restaurants, and Cafes! City guide supports pull-to-refresh and an animated tab slider. Have fun!

City guide does not use dependency injection. 
I started off with Dagger, but I had trouble with injecting Android components and I didn't want to waste too much time becoming a Dagger 
expert considering all the other things I needed to implement. I'd like to convert City guide over to dagger in the future.

I also would have liked to use Retrofit - and I'd very much like to try that out. I may go back and "retro fit" this app in the future.

Also would be fun to do all JSON parsing with gson.
